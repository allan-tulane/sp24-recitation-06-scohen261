- **2)** W(n)= c/2 ⋅n(n−1)

- **3)** S(n) = c

- **4)** The counts increase rapidly for smaller Fibonacci numbers, but the rate of increase gradually slows down as the Fibonacci numbers become larger. 

- **6)** The maximum number of times that `fib_top_down(i)` will be called for any value `i` is equal to the value of `n` itself. The work and span of this function are both O(n).

- **8)** he maximum number of times that `fib_bottom_up(i)` will be called for any value `i` is 1. the work of this function is O(n) and the span is O(1).
